Hydraulic redistribution has the potential to greatly influence the overall performance of agroforestry systems.
Thus, it warrants being implemented in soil hydrology models to improve understanding and planning of agroforestry systems.
As a first step towards this goal, a simple 1D vertical soil hydrology model was proposed, in which the Richards equation \parencite{richards_capillary_1931} is temporally discretized using the Euler backward method coupled with the Picard iteration and spatially discretized using the finite difference method \parencite{celia_general_1990}.
The assumed constitutive relationships between $\theta$ and $h$ and between $K$ and $\theta$ were modelled with the help of the equations laid out by \textcite{genuchten_closed-form_1980}.
Despite its inability to process positive pressure heads, the model did produce realistic results under different boundary conditions and simulation scenarios.
