     not sure whether this is possible, since it requires estimation of theta;
     have to ask Andrea or Mohsen about this

* General notes
** Conventions for file `Projekt_Literaturliste_abstracts.bib´
   + default language is English;
     however, a given name is taken as is from the respective reference (e.g., `Tokio´ instead of `Tokyo´ as a location);
     same goes for abbreviations (e.g., `USA´ instead of `U.S.A.´)
   + entries in field `location´ need to be separated by `and´ (s. biblatex pp. 20, 14)
   + all locations given by a reference are to be included (i.e., all locations were the publisher resides, s. biblatex p. 20)
   + locations in the USA are accompanied by the respective state (e.g., `Hoboken, NJ´)
   + [ ] multiple locations are truncated with [and others] (TODO: modify biber settings)
