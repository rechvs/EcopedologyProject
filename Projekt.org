     not sure whether this is possible, since it requires estimation of theta;
     have to ask Andrea or Mohsen about this
** done deduce equation for C(h) by deriving del theta/del h

     + in the [[file:Octave/Richards.m::1][model code]] H is negative under unsaturated conditions
     + [[file:Octave/van_Genuchten_variables.m::1][van Genuchten variables]] can use negative H as input, since it only uses absolute values of H
   + State "done"       from "CURRENT"    [2016-12-14 Mi 16:13]
** done rewrite/improve function definitions in separate [[file:Octave/functions][files]] (e.g., with respect to documentation (s. [[info:octave#Function%20Headers][here]]), input checking (s. [[info:octave#Defining%20Functions][here]]), etc.)

     + “H_n_plus_1_m_plus_1” does not need sensible values, since it is computed
     + sensible values for “threshold_value” depend on the modelling scenario (larger values for more extreme scenarios)
** on hold set H_i = const. and calculate elements of A
   - State "on hold"    from "CURRENT"    [2017-02-10 Fr 12:15] \\
     Not sure why I considered this necessary. In any case, not a priority at the moment.

     I already have more than enough papers on the topic.

* General notes
** Conventions for file “Projekt_Literaturliste_abstracts.bib”
   + default language is English;
     however, a given name is taken as is from the respective reference (e.g., “Tokio” instead of “Tokyo” as a location);
     same goes for abbreviations (e.g., “USA” instead of “U.S.A.”)
   + entries in field “location” need to be separated by “and” (s. biblatex pp. 20, 14)
   + all locations given by a reference are to be included (i.e., all locations were the publisher resides, s. biblatex p. 20)
   + locations in the USA are accompanied by the respective state (e.g., “Hoboken, NJ”)
   + [ ] multiple locations are truncated with [and others] (TODO: modify biber settings)
** Structure of term paper (cp. email from Martin from 09.02.2017 08:21):
*** 1. Einleitung/Introduction (1 S.)
    + Allgemeine Fragestellung und Darstellung der aktuellen Problemstellung
*** 2. Stand der Wissenschaft/scientific background (2,5 S)
    + widen the scope here (i.e., provide a general overview of topics of interest, even if the related questions will not be answered in the term paper itself) 
    + Literaturübersicht zu Fragen von hydraulic lift und hydraulic redistribution
    + Wasserhaushalt Agroforstsysteme, Schnittstelle Landnutzungen, Parametrisierung an Schnittstellen
    + Verfügbare Modelle, warum neues Modell?
*** 3. Physikalisch-mathematischer Modellansatz/physical-mathematical model (5 S)
    + Richardsgleichung und Picard-Iteration
    + explain favoring implicit instead of explicit solution
    + explain the mathematics as detailed as you consider appropriate
*** 4. Modell-1D Umsetzung/1D model implementation (5 S.)
    + Technische Umsetzung, Testläufe
    + should include both constant pressure head and no (const?) flux at bottom node
*** 5. Zusammenfassung/summary (1-2 S)
